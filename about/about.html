                    I'm Faysal Abdulkadir, a senior Computer Science major at GSU passionate about full-stack
                    development. I build websites and apps that are both functional and fun using <span class="i">
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL.</span>

                    Born in Atlanta, Georgia with Nigerian roots, I stay grounded through travel and new experiences.
                    Outside coding, I enjoy the gym, gaming, ping pong, music, and binge-watching shows like <span class="i">
                    Once Upon A Time and Black Clover</span>
                </p>

                    I chose Computer Science because I've always loved designing and problem-solving. Starting with LEGOs as a
                    kid, I learned the joy of creating, and now I create in the digital world, turning ideas into websites, apps,
                    and tools that poeople can actually use.I live by: <span class="i">In life, you can't grow when you're comfortable"</span>
